# Fraud Detection for E-Commerce and Banking Transactions

## Overview
This project aims to improve the detection of fraud cases in e-commerce and bank credit transactions. By using advanced machine learning models and detailed data analysis, we can accurately spot fraudulent activities and reduce financial losses.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Fraud detection using machine learning models
- Real-time model deployment for fraud detection
- Continuous model evaluation and improvements

### Technologies & Tools:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost
- **Data Analysis & Preprocessing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Geolocation Analysis**: GeoPy, Geopandas
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Deployment**: Flask (for model deployment), Docker (for containerization)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Features:
- **Transaction Data Preprocessing:** Clean and transform raw transaction data for machine learning model input.
- **Fraud Detection Models:** Using classification algorithms to predict fraud.
- **Geolocation Analysis:** Leveraging location-based features to identify suspicious activities.
- **Real-time Fraud Detection:** Deployed models for immediate fraud detection during transactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) (Optional for notebook-based analysis)
